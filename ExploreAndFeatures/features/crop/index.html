        <h1>Rice Cultivation Information</h1>
    
        <h2>Requirements for Rice Cultivation</h2>
        <p>Rice is a staple food for a large part of the world's population. Here are the key requirements for successful rice cultivation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Warm, tropical climates with temperatures between 20°C and 40°C are ideal for rice growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Water:</strong> Rice requires a significant amount of water, often grown in flooded fields known as paddies.</li>
            <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Clay or silty clay soils with good water retention are best for rice cultivation.</li>
            <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Abundant sunlight is necessary for photosynthesis and healthy growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Growing Season:</strong> A long growing season of 3 to 6 months is required for rice to mature.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Withstanding Capacity of Calamities</h2>
        <p>Rice cultivation faces several challenges due to natural calamities. Here are some key points with rough percentage predictions for farmers:</p>
